* We had [Arturo Nereu](https://twitter.com/ArturoNereu/) \(arturo@unity3d.com\) from Unity call in for a Q&A
  * Keeping regular meeting times helps people plan around your organization
  * Delegation and keeping diverse organizers can help a group survive if the founding members leave
  * Unity is willing and able to support events and your user group
    * Meetup group anniversaries
    * Discounts on event tickets \(Unity Unite and other industry events\)
  * Workshops aimed at beginners by people who have a specialization are a good way to create content for your group
  * Unity is suitable for both 3D and 2D development
  * Maya and 3DS Max are both useful for developing shaders, but they can have portability issues
  * Photoshop, Illustrator, GIMP,  and Inkscape are all useful for generating sprites \(_editor's note: also_  [_Krita_](https://krita.org/en/)_!_\)
