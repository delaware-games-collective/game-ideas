# Brainstorming & Spitballing

* Make a board game based on a haunted house/mansion
* Ghost hunting
* 1v4 asymmetrical multiplayer
* The investigators are trying to figure out who the ghost is and what they want/various characteristics about them
* The ghost has a hand of cards/things they can do to effect the game, but they clue in the players as to who they might be
* Ghost’s deck is procedurally generated by combining multiple ghost base decks
  * Each ghost character has their own base set of cards, including 1-2 signature cards that no other ghost characters have access to
  * This is combined with 5 cards from 2 other ghost decks and 3 other cards from 1 other ghost deck, and 7 generic cards that all ghosts have access to
  * 30 cards total, 5 cards/hand
  * If they can play a card, they must
* The ghosts’ cards affect investigators, ex moving them, trapping rooms, moving rooms, lowering player sanity
* Ghost win condition is to mill through their entire deck before the investigators exorcise them
* Investigator’s win condition is to collectively exorcise the ghost, but individually do it their own way, ex psychic might want them to cross over/bring them peace, reporter might want to take a photo for proof, clergyman might want to save their soul, etc
* Players build out the board from a room stack, ala [betrayal](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10547/betrayal-house-hill)
* Rooms are in a grid, either 1 unit or 2
* start with 1 ghost design
  * spooky victorian lady!
* Ghost places items in house + 
* Ghost knows item locations
* Investigators collect items
  * x3
* Investigators have AP \(ability/action points\) they can spend on...
  * movement
  * unlock/lock doors
  * discover items
  * 4 AP per turn
* Ghost has powers
* Investigators have sanity
* Ghost's goal: lower sanity of all players/spook them
* Investigator's Goal: exorcise ghost
  * Discover Items -&gt; Discover exorcising site -&gt; Gather Items + Investigators
* Investigators have meeples
* Ghost does not have a physical pawn
* The maps are pseudo-randomly generated
  * Potentially using a codenames style cheat-sheet for the ghost
* Sanity loss downs investigators
* other investigators and revive downed investigators
* Bright-spooky aesthetic / Nintendo spooky aesthetic / silly-spooky
* the ghost is just, the entire house, like they \*are\* the house, you play as the house
* Room shuffling is an interesting mechanic, maybe it only happens on certain beats
* Room discovery is also an interesting mechanic/is an interesting way to explore
* Might be better to have the ghost have a physical presence, maybe it's part of a secondary phase?
* Phase 1 no ghost body, phase 2 there's a ghost body and after the investigators complete the exorcism they have to trap the body too





* Rooms are in a grid, either 1 unit or 2
* 1 ghost to start with
* ghost places items in house and knows their locations
* investigators collect items x3
* investigators have AP
  * movement
  * unlock doors
  * discover items
  * 4ap/turn
* ghost has powers
* investigators have sanity
* ghost's goal: lower sanity of all players
* investigator's goal: exorcise ghost
  * discover items
  * discover room/site
  * gather
* map pseudo-random, something like codenames key
* charactisitics of spooky houses
  * impossible architecture
  * moving architecture
* make it a tilt5 AR game?
