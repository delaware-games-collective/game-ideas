# Gacha-Style Final Fantasy Tactics

* [**Gacha-Style Final Fantasy Tactics**](https://fire-emblem-heroes.com/en/) ****\(Because we can make mad bucks from people buying JPEGs\)
  * Collectible units are modeled after Dungeon & Dragons / Anime / Waifu Figurines?
    * Side Note: Dragalia Lost is a gacha game with good character design that doesn’t rely on oversexualization that you see in most gacha games ****_**cough**_FireEmblemHeroes_**cough**_ ****
  * Customizable classes and equipment
  * Battles are 5v5 grid and turn based combat 
  * Obligatory swimsuit alts because people are suckers for these for some reason
  * Several battle modes / win conditions that comes to my mind right now
    * Checkmate: Players assigns a unit to be the King and receive benefits / buffs and must defeat the Enemy’s King
    * Domination: Standard 5v5, defeat all the enemies
    * Gauntlet: Co-Op PvE against waves of AI enemies
