# Daily Life of a Thief

* **Daily Life of a Thief**
  * Explore a town a nameless thief, stealing what you can to survive
  * Steal from street markets, nobles, and go dungeon diving
  * Listen to the townspeople’s request and rumors and make a name for yourself
  * Your actions will determine your status and your name live down in fame or in infamy
  * Think like Assassin Creed gameplay with Persona 5 social interaction stuff. I don’t know much about Persona 5 though the idea of being able to talk your way out of things sounds fun.
