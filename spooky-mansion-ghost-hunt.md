# Spooky Mansion Ghost Hunt

* Make a board game based on a haunted house/mansion
* Ghost hunting
* 1v4 asymmetrical multiplayer
* The investigators are trying to figure out who the ghost is and what they want/various characteristics about them
* The ghost has a hand of cards/things they can do to effect the game, but they clue in the players as to who they might be
* Ghost’s deck is procedurally generated by combining multiple ghost base decks
  * Each ghost character has their own base set of cards, including 1-2 signature cards that no other ghost characters have access to
  * This is combined with 5 cards from 2 other ghost decks and 3 other cards from 1 other ghost deck, and 7 generic cards that all ghosts have access to
  * 30 cards total, 5 cards/hand
  * If they can play a card, they must
* The ghosts’ cards affect investigators, ex moving them, trapping rooms, moving rooms, lowering player sanity
* Ghost win condition is to mill through their entire deck before the investigators exorcise them
* Investigator’s win condition is to collectively exorcise the ghost, but individually do it their own way, ex psychic might want them to cross over/bring them peace, reporter might want to take a photo for proof, clergyman might want to save their soul, etc
* Players build out the board from a room stack, ala [betrayal](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10547/betrayal-house-hill)
