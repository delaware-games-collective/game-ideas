# Office Chair Jousting

Gameplay:

* Players will have npcs pushing their mounts
  * The strength of the push determines the handling, accuracy, and strength 
    * Strong push: More distance cover, less handling, aiming may be hard to control, move faster
    * Weak push: Less distance, but more control, able to spin, easy to aim, move slower
  * When the mount began to slow down, players are forced to push themselves back to the npcs to have the full offensive potential. making them susceptible to other players
