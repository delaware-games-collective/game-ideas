Horizon’s Idea Corner

* \*\*\*\*
* [**Gacha-Style Final Fantasy Tactics**](https://fire-emblem-heroes.com/en/) ****\(Because we can make mad bucks from people buying JPEGs\)
  * Collectible units are modeled after Dungeon & Dragons / Anime / Waifu Figurines?
    * Side Note: Dragalia Lost is a gacha game with good character design that doesn’t rely on oversexualization that you see in most gacha games ****_**cough**_FireEmblemHeroes_**cough**_ ****
  * Customizable classes and equipment
  * Battles are 5v5 grid and turn based combat 
  * Obligatory swimsuit alts because people are suckers for these for some reason
  * Several battle modes / win conditions that comes to my mind right now
    * Checkmate: Players assigns a unit to be the King and receive benefits / buffs and must defeat the Enemy’s King
    * Domination: Standard 5v5, defeat all the enemies
    * Gauntlet: Co-Op PvE against waves of AI enemies
* **Town Building + Defense Simulator**
  * You remember Sim City with those stupid Godzilla attacks event? That is the main feature of the game and you build defense to protect the city while maintaining the economic and stuff
* **Supernatural stealth based social gambit**
  * Starting off as a supernatural creature you have to blend into medieval society via watching others from the shadows to learn how to conduct oneself socially while gathering items to protect your home via traps and gathering wealth and influence.
  * The goal is to amass people into following your cult without alerting outsiders to your true nature.
  * With each cult member gain, new abilities will be unlocked to influence even more people and to eliminate your enemies
* Alien: Isolation but in VR
  * You take a port of Alien: Isolation and make it more realistic
  * So learn how to not breathe because mic functionality will be added to attract the alien 
* Flashy combo based fighter
  * A fighting game like Dropkick or Lethal League where the win condition is not simply fighting but it would be like HORSE but doing flashy combos in the most ridiculous way
* **Co-op survival** 
  * You start off as one of 3 types of symbiot and using your ability to combine with others learn to survive.
  * Three classes 
    * spider like 
      * High armor 
      * High mobility 
      * High damage
      * Low health and energy efficiency
    * Human like
      * Medium armor 
      * Medium mobility 
      * Medium health and energy efficiency
      * Medium damage
    * Balloon like 
      * High Health and energy efficiency 
      * Low mobility 
      * Low damage
      * Low armor
  * The stats would change depending on what each type of creature bonds with
